## About

NotionBoost 
You can easily check your Notion information on the Android home screen.

## Usage

### 1. Create an integration from ["My Integrations"](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations/) in Notion.

Please create an integration from [this page](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations/).
You can use any name for the integration. The default permissions granted to the integration include read and update and insert access to content, but NotionBoost only requires read access.

### 2. Register the created integration on your Notion page.

Please register the created Integration Secret on your Notion page. By selecting 'Add Connections' from the `...` in the top-right corner of the page, you will see the integration you created. 
For more details, please check [Notion Developers Guides](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#give-your-integration-page-permissions)

### 3. Enter the Integration Secret in the first screen.

> [!WARNING]
> This screen does not perform Integration Secret validation. If you accidentally register an invalid Integration Secret, you will need to reinstall the app at this time.ã€€(We plan to make it possible to change the Integration Secret within the app.)
