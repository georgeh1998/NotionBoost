## About

NotionBoost 
You can easily check your Notion information on the Android home screen.

## Usage

### 1. Please create an integration from ["My Integrations"](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations/internal/e269868283a74ac3b7c7f01d2c75105b) in Notion.

### 2. Register the created integration on your Notion page.

### 3. On the first screen when you launch the app, enter the Integration Secret you created.

> [!WARNING]
> This screen does not perform Integration Secret validation. If you accidentally register an invalid Integration Secret, you will need to reinstall the app at this time.　(We plan to make it possible to change the Integration Secret within the app.)
